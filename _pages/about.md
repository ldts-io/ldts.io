We are a software development and technology company that wants to make the world a better place and make software run better. Our mission is "to make great software accessible to all."

Our team takes has strong core values and a philosophy that guide us in all the work that we do together. 

Each letter of the LDTS acronym stands for a different core value and passion that we live and breathe with this company (the S has three meanings.) 

L - Leadership: We have taken a new approach to leadership, project management and accountability, by keeping what works and eliminating what doesn't. We not only select and work with the best and brightest leaders, but we also have leaders that help inspire technologists to create and achieve outstanding results. 

D - Development: With our core team of developers we have a few overarching guiding principles: Not a single line of code is unnecessary; everything is meaningful and nothing is wasted. We constantly refactor and re-engineer our code and rethink approaches to ensure that software quality is always the highest possible, that we are using the most up to date standards and best practices, that we use the most innovative and cutting edge technologies that work best and are motivating to use, and that security and performance are intrinsic to our services. 

T - Trust: You can count on us to deliver, and our loyalty to our customers sets us apart. Integrity and dependability never take a backseat to anything, and we always hit our targets.
Transparency- We are bringing honesty and integrity back with full transparency with the most open communication and feedback channels, because communication is so very important in all aspects of software and business. 

S - Service: We want to deliver premium levels of service and delight customers with highly efficient and user friendly software that is easy to use and will help you, not hinder you.

Security: With data breaches on the rise, and with innovation and cloud on the rise and digital transformations creating more and more complex ecosystems, we make sure that security is not forgotten and that security is built into our services, is bulletproof and is cloud ready. 

Social Consciousness - We care about the community, which is why we are such huge proponents of open source and building communities of developers. We think that everyone should benefit from software, and that level playing fields for all are extremely important for society. Knowledge sharing and learning from each other helps us make sure that we can help make software around the world accessible to all and to maximize its positive impact on humanity.
