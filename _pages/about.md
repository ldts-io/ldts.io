<i>"Realizing the potential of software, people and their data."</i>

We are a software development and technology company that wants to help make the community and ultimately the world a better place by making software and companies run better. Our mission is to make great software that is accessible to all, and to have sustainability and social conscious of our community and at the global scale.

Each letter of the <b>LDTS</b> acronym stands for a different core value and passion that we live and breathe with this company (the S has three meanings.) 

<b>L - Leadership:</b> We have taken a new approach to leadership, project management and accountability, by keeping what works and eliminating what doesn't. We not only select and work with the best and brightest leaders, but we also have leaders that help inspire technologists to create and achieve outstanding results. 

<b>D - Development:</b> With our core team of developers we have a few overarching guiding principles: Not a single line of code is unnecessary; everything is meaningful and nothing is wasted. We constantly refactor and re-engineer our code and rethink approaches to ensure that software quality is always the highest possible, that we are using the most up to date standards and best practices, that we use the most innovative and cutting edge technologies that work best and are motivating to use, and that security and performance are intrinsic to our services. 

<b>T - Trust:</b> You can count on us to deliver, and our loyalty to our customers sets us apart. Integrity and dependability never take a backseat to anything, and we always hit our targets.
Transparency- We are bringing honesty and integrity back with full transparency with the most open communication and feedback channels, because communication is so very important in all aspects of software and business. 

<b>S - Service:</b> We want to deliver premium levels of service and delight customers with highly efficient and user friendly software that is easy to use and will help you, not hinder you.

<b>Security:</b> With data breaches on the rise, and with innovation and cloud on the rise and digital transformations creating more and more complex ecosystems, we make sure that security is not forgotten and that security is built into our services, is bulletproof and is cloud ready. 

<b>Social Consciousness</b> - We care about the community, which is why we are such huge proponents of open source and building communities of developers. We think that everyone should benefit from software, and that level playing fields for all are extremely important for society. Knowledge sharing and learning from each other helps us make sure that we can help make software around the world accessible to all and to maximize its positive impact on humanity. 

<b>More about our philosophy when it comes to software</b>

We ultimately envision a company that can provide world class, proessional software services that rival and surpass the largest firms in the industry. Our approach of integrating best practices from the sharpest minds and most reknowned software developers around the world keeps us  at the cutting edge and has brought us incredible success and insight into what makes the technical and business side of software work. We go beyond Agile, and we have custom tailored processes that work and deliver above and beyond client expectations. 

Our passion for technology and adhering to processes that promote excellence in all that do really shines in our work and in our attitude. From attending and hosting local open source realted Meetup groups, to making contributions to local government based open source projects, we want to not only grow in our own skill sets and careers but we also want to share our knowledge with the community.

Our drive and motiation, coupled with our practice of adopting the best from the very best software architects, developers and change managers out there, allows us to provide results faster and to outperform our competitors in terms of project deadlines and in quality vs cost and effort. 

<b>More about our personal philosophy</b>

Our team takes our strong core values seriously and has a philosophy that guide us in all the work that we do together. From hosting our meetings outside while hiking on beautiful beaches and trails in Victoria BC, to making sure our carbon footprint and total waste appraches 0, to supporting chartiable causes we feel strongly about such as human rights, racial and gender equality, protection of the local and global environment and issues realted to housing insecurity, human trafficking, addiction and poverty, we are dedicated to trying to achieve something much greater than a typical software consulting firm and we ultimately are devoted to putting people and community over profit.

We have made a concious decision to reduce our carbon footprint by working remotely and telecommuting whenever possible. Our developers and functional consultants and leadership are based locally, and when we do need resources outside of Victoria BC or Canada they will be remmote. Our company has a very flat structure and there is a lot of overlap between the roles, there are no leaders here that do not have technical experience for example. 

We believe our empathy for others, especially those that are marginalized and vulnerable, is a competitive differentiator and that we can build a better community with the wellbeing of everyone, including equal opportunity for all, is always taken into account in our day to day operations and in our important, strategic company decisions.
